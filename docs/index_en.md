How the plugin works
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After installation, the plugin can be found in its own entry in the `Administration` menu, from where it can be opened.

After opening, all Goobi configuration files are listed on the left-hand side. These can be opened by clicking on the respective icon in order to edit them.

If you open a file, a text editor appears on the right-hand side in which the file can be edited. If you edit and save a file, a backup is automatically created in the defined backup directory.

According to the value set in the configuration file, a certain number of older backups are retained here before they are replaced by newer ones.

If a file has been changed and an attempt is made to change to another file without saving it, the operator is asked how to proceed with the changes.

Within Goobi, help texts can be defined for configuration files, which can be helpful for editing in this editor. The stored help texts are displayed in the left-hand area depending on the file currently open and also have the option of working with formatting here.
